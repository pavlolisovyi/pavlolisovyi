<p>Hello, if I were a UNIX-based machine and if someone write the command "whoami" my shortest answer would be the following:</p>

<p>"Hi, my name is Vladimir and currently I am a Master student in Computer Sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), building a career in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence." However, let me introduce myself properly and to explain what is the aim of this blog.</p>

<p>I am Vladimir Ilievski and I am from Macedonia. My area of interest is the Machine Learning, more specifically the Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks,
Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Short Term Memory Networks.</p>

<p>This year, for the first time in my life I was accepted to participate in the Google Summer of Code under the mentorship
of CERN-HSF umbrella organization, working on the project "Convolutional Deep Neural Networks on GPUs for Particle Physics Applications".
For this reason I am creating this blog, in order to publish my progress throughout the summer. However, I am in plan
to continue maintaining the blog, since from September I will start my Master Thesis Project, which will be another interesting endeavor.</p>

<p>I hope someone will find my blog interesting and useful to read. Feel free to contact me and give suggestions and comments.</p>
